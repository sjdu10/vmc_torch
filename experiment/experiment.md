# TODO:

1. Compare fPEPS-NN model with Neural Backflow model on 4x4 spinful Fermi-Hubbard model. U/t=8, n=0.875, E_ed = -11.868. [ ]
2. Implement variational PEPS model using BP TN contraction. [ ]
3. Implement variational model for spinful fermions. [ ]
4. Implement function to transform a U1 array to a Z2 array. [ ]
5. Or implement a NN model with dynamic output length! [ ]
