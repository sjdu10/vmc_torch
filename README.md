# ⚛️ vmc_torch: High-Performance Variational Monte Carlo with PyTorch

## Overview

`vmc_torch` is a **high-performance, parallelized implementation of Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)** designed to accurately determine the **ground-state properties** of quantum many-body lattice Hamiltonians.

Built upon **PyTorch**, this library offers unparalleled flexibility, enabling researchers to seamlessly integrate and train cutting-edge quantum *Ansätze*, including Neural Quantum States (NQS) and sophisticated Tensor Network States (TNS), and hybrid TN-NN models such as NN-fTNS [1].

### Key Features and Capabilities

* **Diverse Variational Ansätze Support:** Supports a wide spectrum of modern wavefunctions:
    * **Neural Quantum States (NQS):** Leveraging PyTorch's native capabilities for large-scale, trainable neural network models.
    * **Tensor Network States (TNS):** Integrates with state-of-the-art TN libraries (`quimb`, `symmray`) for handling Matrix Product States (MPS), Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), and more, bosonic or fermionic.
    * **Neuralized fermionic TNS (NN-fTNS):** Hybrid TN-NN model that improves over both fermionic TNS and NQS, see [1] for details.
    * **Tensor Network Functions (TNF):** Function defined by tensor networks with arbitrary geometry. E.g. TNF derived from (1+1)D quantum circuit that supports volume-law entanglement structure, see [2] for details.
* **Massively Parallel VMC Sampling:** Utilizes **`mpi4py`** to distribute the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, suitable on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
* **HPC Ready:** Built for large-scale VMC calculations, suitable for deployment across **thousands of CPU cores**. **Note:** *Current implementation is optimized for CPU cores via MPI. GPU acceleration is actively under development.*
* **Auto-differentiation for Optimization:** Leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine for efficient, large-scale energy minimization using techniques like Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) and other state-of-the-art ML optimizers.

## 🚀 Installation

**Installing the latest version directly from github:**

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/sjdu10/vmc_torch.git
```

**Installing a local, editable development version:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjdu10/vmc_torch.git
pip install --no-deps -U -e vmc_torch/
```

## 📖 Usage Example

**Fermionic neural network quantum state example:**

In `/examples`, there's an example script for running VMC for ground state of a `4x2` Fermi-Hubbard model (OBC) on square lattice at half-filling using Slater Determinant.

To run the code: 
```bash
cd ./examples
mpirun -np 10 python vmc_run_example.py
```
Feel free to substitute the number `10` with any number of MPI ranks you want to use.
